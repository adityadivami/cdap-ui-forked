/**
 * Groups all input objects into collections, and performs an aggregation on the entire group.
 * Objects that have the same group key are placed into the same group for aggregation.
 * It has better performance than {@link Aggregator} since the number of group values is reduced in each split before
 * grouping all the values for the group key.
 *
 * For example, to aggregate and compute the average for the values, the plugin will first group all the values based
 * on the group key, considering it generates following splits:
 * Split 1: (key1, 1), (key1, 2), (key1, 3), (key2, 4)
 * Split 2: (key1, 2), (key1, 3), (key1, 4), (key2, 4)
 * Split 3: (key1, 3), (key1, 4), (key1, 5), (key2, 4)
 * The reduce function will be called in each split to generate following:
 * Split 1: (key1, sum: 6, count: 3), (key2, sum: 4, count: 1)
 * Split 2: (key1, sum: 9, count: 3), (key2, sum: 4, count: 1)
 * Split 3: (key1, sum: 12, count: 3), (key2, sum: 4, count: 1)
 * Then reduce function is called when grouping all values in the split:
 * Grouped result 1: (key1, sum: 27, count: 9)
 * Grouped result 2: (key2, sum: 12, count: 3)
 * At last, aggregate function is called to generate final result:
 * Final: (key1, avg: 3), (key2, avg: 4)
