   * are registered. Config properties that contain macros will not have been evaluated yet.
   *
   * When the pipeline is run, this is called when preparing the run in order to validate the pipeline. Config
   * properties that contain macros will be evaluated at this point. Since schema may be affected by macro evaluation,
